				</div>
				<div class="sportsintro">
				During the 2016-17 Lake Conference girls basketball season, many
				 local players earned statewide attention.
				<br><br>
				Three of them – Edina senior forward Annika Jank, Wayzata sopho-
				more forward Kallie Theisen and Hopkins ninth-grade guard Paige
 				Bueckers – were recently named to the Minnesota Girls Basketball
 				 Coaches’ All-State team.
				<br><br>
				Bueckers is the youngest All-State player in Class 4A after a brilliant 
				season this winter. She led the Lake Conference in scoring with 21
				 points per game and helped the Royals to second place in the State 
				 Tournament. <br><br>Jank finished her career as Edina’s all-time leading 
				 rebounder and will take her talents to Colorado University in Boulder next
				  season. Theisen, who is a similar player to Jank, had a string of 12 
				  double-doubles during her sophomore season with Wayzata. 
				<!-- Hopkins head coach Brian Cosgriff, whose team posted a 31-1 record, praised 
				his five All-Lake players.
				“Our senior guard, Dee Dee Winston, was like a coach on the floor,” he said. -->

				</a>
				
				<div class="eduintro">
				To put his film-making skills to the test, Armstrong High School 
				senior Gabe Hostetler entered Discovery’s TeenDrive365 Video Challenge
				and is on his way to winning $15,000 and the chance to work.
				<br><br>
				Hostetler’s video is among the top 10 finalists, of 1,500 submissions,
				 and viewers could vote for their favorite video through April 18.
				  Winners will be announced by the end of April. The first-place 
				  winner will receive the opportunity to shoot the video into a 
				  public service announcement with a Discovery film crew.

				“It’s an honor to be selected among the nation’s most talented 
				young filmmakers,” Hostetler said. 
				
				From the script to casting, Hostetler created a one-minute distracted 
				driving video “One Decision.”
				“I wanted to come at a teen car accident from a different perspective … 
				from the perspective of your loved ones and how much if would hurt them 
				if anything happened to you,” Hostetler said

				</a> <!-- commtitlebar -->
				<div class="commintro">
				It’s Tuesday morning in Wayzata, and school is in session at The Blake 
				School’s Highcroft Campus. It’s quiet – until it’s not – when a steady rhythm of West African drumming spills into the halls from a downstairs rehearsal room.<br>
				<br>
				An investigatory look into the classroom reveals a drum circle of 18 fifth graders rehearsing for their spring play. Leading the group is Fatawu Sayibu, a Ghana-born master drummer, dancer and choreographer. Since early February, Sayibu has met with students from Blake’s Wayzata and Hopkins campuses. Drawing from a lifetime of experience, Sayibu has been teaching prekindergarten through fifth-grade students about West African culture through drumming and dance.
				“I started doing performances when I was 4,” Sayibu, 33, said.
				At 12 years old, Sayibu began teaching dance at a cultural center in Tamale, the capital town in the Northern Region of Ghana.
				“Any time they would bring students from other schools, my friends and I would teach them,” he said.
