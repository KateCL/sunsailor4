				<p id="edutext">To put his film-making skills to the test, Armstrong High 
				School senior Gabe Hostetler entered Discovery’s TeenDrive365 Video Challenge 
				and is on his way to winning $15,000 and the chance to work. <br>
				<br>
				Hostetler’s video is among the top 10 finalists, of 1,500 submissions, 
				and viewers could vote for their favorite video through April 18. Winners
				 will be announced by the end of April. The first-place winner will receive
				  the opportunity to shoot the video into a public service announcement with
				   a Discovery film crew.<br>
				<br>
				“It’s an honor to be selected among the nation’s most talented young filmmakers,” Hostetler said.<br>
				
				From the script to casting, Hostetler created a one-minute distracted driving 
				video “One Decision.” <br>
				
				“I wanted to come at a teen car accident from a different perspective … 
				from the perspective of your loved ones and how much if would hurt them if 
				anything happened to you,” Hostetler said. <br>
				<br>
				Going to a school that’s been impacted by a distracted driving accident, 
				Hostetler also wanted it to be an emotional message that would resonate 
				among his fellow classmates and underclassmen.<br>
				<br>
				“The decisions you make affect your loved ones” <br> 
				<br>
				The “iconic shot” introducing the first scene, turned out exactly how 
				he wanted. “I dreamed of that image,” Hostetler said, which is also 
				the thumbnail for the video. <br>
				<br>
				The shot he’s referring to is of a woman crying as emergency responders 
				work behind her. Viewers come to find out she is the mother crying at the
				 scene of her son’s crash.<br>
				<br>
				The video flashes back to where she is teaching her son how to parallel 
				park, moving on to the day she hands him the keys to his own vehicle.
				At one point, she warns her son to turn off his phone when he’s driving. 
				“If your phone dings, if it rings, you’re going to turn and look at it. 
				I want it off in the car,” she says.<br>
				<br> 			
				The scene continues to her son driving in his car. When his phone dings, 
				he picks it up. The sound of a crash leaves viewers to connect the first 
				and final scenes as it ends with the words “One Decision – Turn the Phone 
				Off.”<br>
				<br>
				Hostetler was first introduced to film-making in elementary school by 
				his brother, John-Mark, who is nine years his senior. <br>
				<br>
				About three years ago, Hostetler began to really getting serious about 
				making films. <br>
				<br>
				He become a young entrepreneur by starting his own film-making company, 
				Young Vision, which produces music videos for local artists and 
				promotional videos for businesses. <br>
				<br>
				From writing the script and bringing a team together, to filming and 
				editing, “I love the whole process,” said Hostetler. <br>
				<br>
				“Even if I don’t win, I know I did a good thing with this video,” he said, 
				acknowledging the support he’s received as being such a blessing.
