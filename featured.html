	<span class="big">In</span> a world as unmannerly as this one, how is it best to speak?
There’s no need to be rude, I say to the man in the packed hall at passport control. 
There are people everywhere, and his job is to send them into the right queues. I have 
been watching him shout at them. I have watched the obsessive way he notices them, to 
pick on them. There’s no need to be rude, I say.<br>
His head jerks around.
<span class="speech">You’re rude,</span> he counters. <span class="speech">You’re the one who’s rude.</span><br>
This is an airport, a place of transit. There are all sorts of people here, people of 
different ages, races and nationalities, people in myriad sets of circumstances. In this 
customs hall, there are so many different versions of living that it seems possible that 
no one version could ever be agreed on. Does it follow, then, that nothing that happens 
here really matters?<br>
No, I’m not, I say.<br>
You are, he says. You’re being rude.<br>
<br>
The man is wearing a uniform, though not a very impressive one: a white short-sleeved 
synthetic shirt, black synthetic trousers, a cheap tie with the airport’s insignia on 
it. It is no different from the uniform a bus driver might wear, or someone at a 
car-rental desk, someone who lacks any meaningful authority while also being forced into 
constant interaction with members of the public, someone for whom the operation of 
character is both nothing and everything. He is angry. His face is red, and his expression 
is unpleasant. He looks at me — a woman of 48 traveling alone, a woman who doubtless 
exhibits some signs of the privileged life she has led — with loathing. Apparently it is 
I, not he, who has broken the social code. Apparently it was rude of me to accuse him of 
rudeness.<br>
<br>
The social code remains unwritten, and it has always interested me how many problems 
this poses in the matter of ascertaining the truth. The truth often appears in the guise 
of a threat to the social code. It has this in common with rudeness. When people tell the 
truth, they can experience a feeling of release from pretense that is perhaps similar to 
the release of rudeness. It might follow that people can mistake truth for rudeness, and 
rudeness for truth. It may only be by examining the aftermath of each that it becomes 
possible to prove which was which.<br>
<br>
The queue moves forward. I reach passport control, and I pass through it, and the man is 
left behind.<br>
<br>
In recounting this incident afterward, I find myself running into difficulties. For 
instance, I find myself relying on the details of the man’s physical ugliness to prove 
the badness of his character. Searching for a specific example of someone else’s being 
upset or offended by him, the only person I can prove he offended was me. On another day, 
a perfectly polite man is probably to be found directing the crowds in the customs hall, 
assisting the elderly, apologizing for the crush, helpfully explaining things to people 
whose English is uncertain: He would make a good story about individuality as the basis 
for all hope.<br>
<br>
By telling this story, I am trying to substantiate my fear that discrimination and 
bullying are used against people trying to enter Britain, my country. There are many 
people who don’t have this fear. To them, my story proves only one thing, which is that 
I once met a rude man in an airport. I might even have inadvertently made them pity him. 
I, the teller of this tale, would have to demonstrate that under the same circumstances, 
I would have behaved better. In the event, all I did was criticize him. I made him angrier; 
perhaps he took it out on the next person in the queue. To top it all off, I admit that 
he accuses me of precisely the same failing: rudeness. Anyone hearing the story will at 
this point stop thinking about the moral problem of rudeness and start thinking about me. 
I have damaged my own narrative authority: Might I be to blame after all? By including 
that detail — true though it is — I am giving the man a platform for his point of view. 
In most of my stories, I allow the truth to look after itself. In this one, I’m not sure 
that it can.<br>
<br>
For all these reasons, the story doesn’t work as it should. Why, then, if it proves 
nothing, is this a story I persist in telling? The answer: because I don’t understand it. 
I don’t understand it, and I feel that the thing I don’t understand about it — indeed the 
mere fact of not understanding — is significant.<br>
<br>
Another day, another airport. This time the situation is clearer: My country has recently 
voted to leave the European Union, and rudeness is rampant. People treat one another with 
a contempt that they do not trouble to conceal. The people in uniforms — the airport 
officials — exercise their faux power with uncommon ugliness, while the rest of us look 
suspiciously at one another, not sure what to expect of this new, unscripted reality, 
wondering which side the other person is on. It is already being said that this situation 
has arisen out of hatred, but it seems to me that if that is true, then the hatred is of 
self. <br>
<br>
The uniformed woman at security bangs the gray plastic trays one after another onto the 
conveyor belt with a violence that seems to be a request for attention. At every 
opportunity, she makes it clear that she has relinquished self-control: Her nature has 
been let loose, like an animal from its cage. She abuses, without exception, every person 
who passes along her queue, while seeming not to address any single one of them: We are no 
longer individuals; we are a herd enduring the drover’s lash, heads down and silent. She 
looks unhealthy, her face covered with sore-looking red spots, her shapeless white body 
almost writhing with its own anger, as though it wishes only to transgress its boundaries, 
to escape itself in an act of brutality.<br>
<br>
The person in front of me in the queue is a well-groomed black woman. She is traveling 
with a child, a pretty girl with neatly plaited hair. She has put two large clear bags 
of cosmetics and creams in her tray, but this, apparently, is not allowed; she is 
permitted only a single bag. The uniformed woman halts the queue and slowly and 
deliberately holds up the two bags, looking fixedly at their owner.<br>
<br>
What’s this then? she says. What’s this about?<br>
<br>
The woman explains that because two of them are traveling, she has assumed that they 
are entitled to two bags. Her voice is quiet and polite. The little girl gazes ahead 
with wide, unblinking eyes.<br>
<br>
You assumed wrong, the uniformed woman says. Her horrible relish for the situation is 
apparent. She has been waiting, it is clear, to fasten on someone and has found her victim.<br>
<br>
You don’t get away with that, she says, grimacing and shaking her head. Where do people 
like you get your ideas from?<br>
<br>
The rest of us watch while she makes the woman unpack the bags and then decide which of 
her possessions are to be thrown away. They are mostly new and expensive-looking. In 
another situation, their scented femininity might have seemed to mock the ugliness of 
the woman superintending their destruction with folded arms and a jeering expression on 
her face. The other woman’s slender, varnished fingers are shaking as she scrabbles with 
the various pots and jars. She keeps dropping things, her head bowed, her lower lip caught 
in her teeth. The uniformed woman’s unremitting commentary on these events is so unpleasant 
that I realize she is half-demented with what would seem to be the combination of power 
and powerlessness. No one intervenes. I do not inform her that there is no need to be rude. 
Instead, as I increasingly seem to in such situations these days, I wonder what Jesus would 
have done.<br>
<br>
My traveling companion — a painter — is the politest person I know, but I have noticed 
that he does not often take up arms on another person’s behalf. He dislikes conflict. When 
it is our turn in the queue, the uniformed woman stares at the bag he has placed in the tray. 
It contains his tubes of paint. They are crumpled and bespattered with use, and there are 
so many of them that the bag can’t close at the top. She folds her arms. <br>
<br>
What are those, she says.<br>
<br>
They’re paints, he replies.<br>
<br>
You can’t take those through, she says.<br>
<br>
Why not, he asks pleasantly.<br>
<br>
The bag has to close at the top, she says. That’s why not.<br>
<br>
But I need them to paint with, he says.<br>
<br>
You can’t take them through, she says.<br>
<br>
He looks at her in silence. He is looking directly into her eyes. He stands completely 
quiet and still. The look goes on for a very long time. Her eyes are small and pale blue 
and impotent: I did not notice them until now. My friend neither blinks nor looks away, 
and the woman is forced to hold herself there as the seconds tick by, her small eyes open 
and straining. During those seconds, it seems as if layers of her are being removed: She 
is being simplified, put in order, by being looked at. He is giving her his full 
attention, and I watch the strange transformation occur. Finally he speaks.<br>
<br>
What do you suggest I do, he says, very calmly.<br>
<br>
Well, sir, she says, if you’re traveling with this lady, she might have room in her bag.<br>
<br>
Neither of them looks at me — they are still looking at each other.<br>
<br>
Would that be acceptable? she says.
Yes, he says, I don’t see why not.<br>
<br>
I proffer my bag, and the woman herself transfers the paints from one bag to the other. 
Her hands labor to do it with care and exactitude: It takes her a long time. Finally she 
seals the bag and lays it gently back in the tray.<br>
<br>
Is that all right, sir? she says.<br>
<br>
Now that he has won this victory, I want him to use it to reprimand her, not just for her 
behavior toward the black woman in the queue but for all the wrongs her behavior 
represents; for the fact that it’s safer to be him, and always has been. He does not 
reprimand her. He smiles at her politely.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, he says.<br>
<br>
It would have been a shame to throw them away, wouldn’t it? she says.<br>
<br>
Yes, it would, he says. I appreciate your help.<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy your holiday, sir, she says.<br>
<br>
Society organizes itself very efficiently to punish, silence or disown truth-tellers. 
Rudeness, on the other hand, is often welcomed in the manner of a false god. Later still, 
regret at the punishment of the truth-teller can build into powerful feelings of worship, 
whereas rudeness will be disowned.<br>
<br>
Are people rude because they are unhappy? Is rudeness like nakedness, a state deserving 
the tact and mercy of the clothed? If we are polite to rude people, perhaps we give them 
back their dignity; yet the obsessiveness of the rude presents certain challenges to the 
proponents of civilized behavior. It is an act of disinhibition: Like a narcotic, it offers 
a sensation of glorious release from jailers no one else can see.<br>
<br>
In the recollection of events, rudeness often has a role to play in the moral construction 
of a drama: It is the outward sign of an inward or unseen calamity. Rudeness itself is not 
the calamity. It is the harbinger, not the manifestation, of evil. In the Bible, Satan is 
not rude — he is usually rather charming — but the people who act in his service are. 
Jesus, on the other hand, often comes across as somewhat terse. Indeed, many of the people 
he encounters find him direct to the point of rudeness. The test, it is clear, is to tell 
rudeness from truth, and in the Bible that test is often failed. An unambiguous event — 
violence — is therefore required. The episode of the crucifixion is an orgy of rudeness 
whose villains are impossible to miss. The uncouth conduct of the Roman soldiers at the 
foot of the cross, for instance, can be seen in no other light: Anyone thinking that Jesus 
could have done a bit more to avoid his fate is offered this lasting example of humanity’s 
incurable awfulness. They know not what they do, was Jesus’ comment on his tormentors. 
Forgive them.<br>
<br>
In the United Kingdom, the arguments rage over the rights and wrongs of the Brexit 
referendum result. I begin to think this is what it must be like to be the child of 
divorcing parents. Before, there was one truth, one story, one reality; now there are 
two. Each side accuses the other, and amid the raised voices, the unappeasable points 
of view, the vitriol and distress, the obfuscation and exaggeration and blame, the only 
thing that is demonstrably clear is that one side is ruder than the other. It seems to 
me that even if you didn’t know what they were arguing about, you would have to come to 
that conclusion.<br>
<br>
In the aftermath of their victory, the winners are markedly unmagnanimous. They brand 
those who voted the other way as a liberal elite, patronizing, self-interested, out of 
touch with real life. The liberal elite are characterized as bad losers, as though the 
vote were a football match. When they protest against or complain about the result and 
its consequences, they are immediately belittled and shouted down. In the weeks before the 
vote, the eventual victors’ own handling of language resembled a small child’s handling 
of an explosive device: They appeared to have no idea of its dangers or power. They used 
phrases like “We want our country back” and “Take back control” that were open to any and 
every interpretation. Now they complain that they have been misrepresented as racist, 
xenophobic, ignorant. They are keen to end the argument, to quit the field of language 
where only the headachy prospect of detailed analysis remains, to take their dubious 
verbal victory and run for the hills. They have a blunt phrase they use in the hope of 
its being the last word, and it is characteristically rude: “You lost. Get over it.”<br>
<br>
The liberal elite, meanwhile, have evolved a theory: It is their belief that many of the 
people who voted to leave the European Union now regret their decision. There is no more 
tenuous comfort than that which rests on the possibility of another’s remorse. In 
psychoanalysis, events are reconstructed in the knowledge of their outcome: The therapeutic 
properties of narrative lie in its capacity to ascribe meaning to sufferings that at the 
time seemed to have no purpose. The liberal elite are in shock; they fall upon the notion 
of the victors’ regret as a palliative for their mental distress, but because the referendum 
result is irreversible, this narrative must adopt the form of tragedy.<br>
<br>
Unlike the victors, the losers are loquacious. They render the logic of their suffering 
with exactitude and skill, waxing to new expressive heights. The deluge of fine writing 
that follows the referendum contrasts strangely with the reticence that preceded it. The 
liberal elite are defending their reality, but too late. Some urge a show of tolerance and 
understanding; others talk about the various stages of grief; others still call for courage 
in standing up for the values of liberalism. These are fine performances, but it is unclear 
whom they are for. I have often noticed how people begin to narrate out loud when in the 
presence of mute creatures, a dog, say, or a baby: Who is the silent witness to this verbal 
outpouring?<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the Essex town of Harlow, a Polish man is murdered in the street by a gang of 
white youths who apparently heard him speaking his native language.<br>
<br>
How can we ascertain the moral status of rudeness? Children are the members of our society 
most often accused of being rude; they are also the most innocent. We teach children that 
it is rude to be honest, to say, “This tastes disgusting” or “That lady is fat.” We also 
teach them that it is rude to disrespect our authority. We give them orders: We say, 
“Sit still” or “Go to your room.” At a certain point, I got into the habit, when addressing 
my children, of asking myself whether I would speak in the same way to an adult and 
discovered that in nearly every case the answer was no. At that time, I understood rudeness 
to be essentially a matter of verbal transgression: It could be defined within the morality 
of language, without needing to prove itself in a concrete act. A concrete act makes language 
irrelevant. Once words have been superseded by actions, the time for talking has passed. 
Rudeness, then, needs to serve as a barrier to action. It is what separates thought from 
deed; it is the moment when wrongdoing can be identified, in time to stop the wrong from 
having to occur. Does it follow, then, that a bigoted remark — however ugly to hear — is 
an important public interface between idea and action? Is rudeness a fundamental aspect 
of civilization’s immunity, a kind of antibody that is mobilized by the contagious presence 
of evil?<br>
<br>
In the United States, Hillary Clinton calls half the supporters of Donald Trump “a basket 
of deplorables.” At first the remark impressed me. I approved of Clinton for her courage and 
honesty, while reflecting on her curious choice of words. “Basket of deplorables” almost 
sounded like a phrase from Dr. Seuss: It would be typical of him to put deplorables in a 
basket, for the moral amusement of his young readers. A sack or a box of deplorables wouldn’t 
be the same thing at all, and a swamp of deplorables is too Dante-esque; but a basket is 
just the kind of zany, cheerful container that makes light of the deplorables while still 
putting them in their place. It quickly became clear, however, that as a public utterance, 
the phrase was malfunctioning. The basket began to speak, to distinguish itself: Inside 
it were a number of offended individuals. Clinton had made the mistake of being rude. The 
“basket of deplorables” wasn’t Dr. Seuss after all. It was the snobbish language of the 
liberal elite, caught committing the elemental moral crime of negating individual human 
value. Yet Clinton’s adversary regularly committed this crime with impunity. Were Clinton’s 
and Trump’s two different kinds of rudeness?<br>
<br>
In Britain, a man tweets that someone should “Jo Cox” Anna Soubry. The amorality of the 
English tongue: In the run-up to the referendum, Jo Cox, a member of Parliament, was shot 
and stabbed to death by a far-right nationalist; to “Jo Cox” someone is to murder a female 
member of Parliament who advocates remaining in the European Union. The man who posts the 
tweet is arrested. The police, it seems, are trying to get on top of our verbal problems. 
It has now become commonplace for proponents of liberal values to receive death threats. 
The death threat, I suppose, is the extreme of rudeness: It is the place where word finally 
has to be taken as deed, where civilization’s immunity reaches the point of breakdown. 
“I could kill you,” my mother often used to say to me, and I didn’t know whether to believe 
her or not. It is true that I frequently fell foul of her and others through my habit of 
outspokenness. The sharpness of my phrases maddened her. I was quite capable of the 
basket-of-deplorables mistake, the confusion of cleverness with insult, the belief in 
language as an ultimate good, the serving of which was its own reward. No one could mind 
what you said if you said it with sufficient skill, could they? Later I came to believe 
that the good of language lay entirely in its relationship to truth. Language was a system 
through which right and wrong — truth and untruth — could be infallibly identified. Honesty, 
so long as it was absolute, was a means for individuals to understand all good and evil.
